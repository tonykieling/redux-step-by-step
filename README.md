# redux-step-by-step

## What is it?
This is a project to primarly practice Redux.  
It has 3 versions, with different scenarios or features:  
1. v1 is an one file app running on Node.js,  
2. v2 changes a little bit v1 and basically adds values to the action in the reducer,  
3. v3 is a React environment and also persist data. More information in the README.md for that directory.  
*p.s. - v1 and v2 are self explanatory because they are commented*
